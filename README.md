## Description
This is a simple Chrome Extension to track all my favorite shopping websites, so I can reference back whenever I feel like buying things. 
Oftentimes when I see something I like, I either put the link to the product in my note or bookmark it. 
But as you can imagine, my bookmark was overcrowded, considering I have other websites besides shopping I'd like to bookmark. 
I think many people can relate to this, and this extension could help solve this inconvenience.
